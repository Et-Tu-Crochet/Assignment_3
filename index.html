            <p>The Meta Quest 2 (formerly known as Oculus Quest 2) is the best VR headset to buy for most people. It offers
                the most versatility and the best value in the most affordable package available.</p>

            <h3><a href="valve.html">Valve Index</a></h3>

            <p>The Valve Index is an old dog in the market, but Valve's first, and so far, only VR headset remains one of the best
                that money can buy today. Unfortunately, in terms of resolution, the Index is lagging behind the rest of the 
                market. The headset boasts dual 1440 x 1600 LCD panels for crisp but not mind-blowing image clarity. The variable 
                refresh rate setting allows you to dial in displays to match your PC's performance; which is an incredible help
                when you have a less-powerful graphics card in your system. The Index Supports 80, 90, 120, and 144 Hz configurations.</p>
